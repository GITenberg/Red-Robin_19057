description: Moira O'Donnell who had never been farther than the boundaries of her
  county knew the whole world was beautiful too. On a green hillside a girl lay prone
  in the sweet grass, very still that she might not, by the slightest quiver, disturb
  the beauty that was about her. There was so very, very much beauty - the sky, azure
  blue overhead and paling where it touched the green-fringed earth; the whispering
  tree under which she lay, the lush meadow grass, moving like waves of a sea, the
  bird nesting above her, everything - And Moira O'Donnell, who had never been farther
  than the boundaries of her county, knew the whole world was beautiful, too. Behind
  her, hid in a hollow, stood the small cottage where, at that very moment, her grandmother
  was preparing the evening meal. And, beyond, in the village was the little old stone
  church and Father Murphy's square bit of a house with its wide doorstep and its
  roof of thatch, and Widow Mulligan's and the Denny's and the Finnegan's and all
  the others. Moira loved them all and loved the hospitable homes where there was
  always, in spite of poverty, a bounty of good feeling. And before her, just beyond
  that last steep rise, was the sea. She could hear its roar now, like a deep voice
  drowning the clearer pipe of the winging birds and the shrill of the little grass
  creatures.
